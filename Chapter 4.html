    <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <p>The sun began to arise from the sea, shinging its bright rays of light. Quntamiun slowly opening his eyes to see a tree near him that had a craved message "meet the man at seadock", memories from yesterday rushed back to him and he shoots out the bed. Running through the plaza he dumped into a shop keeper "hey Quntanium" the shop keeper said joyfully "the plaza's annual festival is happening tonight, if you like you can help us get ready,". Quntamiun quickly replied "N-no thanks I have to see someone at the seadock". "Well the seadock is just right side of the plaza, goodluck" said the happy shop keeper. Quntamiun panting, made it to the shipping dock just in time for the tall man to see him. The tall figure blankly looks at the nearly exhausted Quntamiun, "Come I'll get ourselves a motorboat for our journey out at sea".</p>
        <p>And so the two adventours soon got themselves a motorboat and headed out to the far ocean. As the motorboat picks up speed creating ripples along open sea, splashing saltwater on their faces. Quntanium decides to talk to the tall figure, "so...uhm whats your name and where you from?". The tall man then spoke in a spanish accent "If you insist Im from Cudillero, Spain it's a lovely place there, my friends called me "Flameco rojo"  but for now on my name is Hugo Marco". Quntanium seeing the conversation going somewhere he replied,"well my name is Quntamium and I come from the sea" he said gladly. "The sea-eehh" Hugo curious he conntinues, "if you're from the sea the how are you breathing oxygen should you be gasping for air...unless". Quntaium irritated he stands up and states "alright look here im not a human pretending to be a shark, no im not a test experiment from a mad doctor, no im not some kind of magical deity that grants wishes. All I know is that I came from the sea and got washed up here" then he sat down angrily. Hugo chuckles, finding someone who is like him too. Hugo then calmy said,"Quntanium let me tell you a short story". Back in my home town when I was your age I was the prettiest boy there. All the girls at my town loved me for my looks calling me the "Flamenco", but I got tired, of my popularity, like can a guy just get piece and quite? I got annoyed by the moment a group of girls shouting my name, and It didn't any better help when the other guys noticed it too. Always getting myself in trouble when a girl falls in love with me instead another man. The boys call me all sorts of names Theif of hearts, King of lust, Rasput√≠n de Cudillero man I hated that name especially. I soon left town to joined a voyage and visted many places and met many friends". Quntanium, a upset stubborn wall pays no attenion to Hugo's story, but Hugo's chuckles looking at Qunatnium with sympathy he says, "Everyones different, but you are different in a way that makes you special,, you'll soon see other people who are like you one day". Hugo's warm-hearted words melts Quntanium's icy posture. </p>
        <p>Hugo took a look at his compass, and Hugo  went back to the mysterious deep voice "Now you might be wondering why We're here, around about this area on the seabed there is there isa red glowing lantern. You, Quntanium have go down to the seabed to retrive it and we'll continue from there" Quntanium with unease proceds to follow his instructions "here's go nothing" he said nervously. He cannonballs into the water a few feet deep he opened his eyes the cyan colored oval eyes helps him see better underwater, unlike humans they need diving masks to see clearly, gills aside his neck enabling  itto breath alongsidealong the fishes. As he dive deeper Quntaium was marveled at the group atmosphere. Seeing different creatures that inhabit this sancturay and fellow sharks passing by, and the sunlight percing through the deep waters, "My home..." he said to himself. As he looked down in the abyss to see a dimming red glowing light, "that must be the lantern-thing he's talking about" as he dive deeper and deeper the sunlight dulls and the glowing lantern begans to iluminate a small area around it.
It was almost sundown when Quntanium reached back into the boat, "got the lantern thing you talked about", "good job now we head back to the seadock" said Hugo with a deep grim voice. At the seadock Quntanium and Hugo returned the boat. Hugo said to Quntanium "Now we will go to a anbandoned location, luckly I saw an run down shack looks like no one was using iit so well use the lantern there", Quntamium with a sense of unease and worry braved on. They both walked to the abandoned building and Quntanium having doubts about Hugo main intentions on using the glowing lantern, so he askes Hugo "so why are we going to the abandoned building to use the lanternantern." Hugoe response, "look if you are too afriaid about this you can go home. I can go alone". Quntanium disturded by his reply. "Theres nothing for me back home, we made it this far you still might need my help for something", Quntanium enforcing his obligation to Hugo, they both proceeded to the building.</p>
