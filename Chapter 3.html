    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <p>The next day Quntanium was lying on his mammock, while admiring the scenery he was also thinking about what he should do today. "Mmm...I can go to the plaza see if people need my help" he said. So again he went to the plaza finding what he can do. Shop after shop he was given tasks some hard and some so easy, soon it got boring sure he was given appreciation from store owners and some money, but Quntanium was unsatisfied wishing for something to happen,ed,. but in the shadows a tall figure was watching.</p>
    <p>Quntanium accepting a job as a adverstiser for a fish market. "Fresh caught fish come get your fresh caught fish". He shouted as loud as he can but no one paid attenion, and that is when the tall figure walked up to him, the tall figure was wearing a black tarnished coat covering his body, wearing a black scarf and a wide brim hat consealing his face. "Hello sir would you like fresh caugh fish" Quntanium said lazily. The tall figure was silent not uttering a single word just staring at Quntanium. Quntanium continues "Would you like some fresh fish well the store is over th-". The tall unknown figure broke his silence asking Quntamiun a question "Do you wish to be an adventurer? Are you worthy enough?" The words caught Quntamiun his attention knocking out his boardem. Quntamiun replied hesitantly "Yea I want to be a adventurer, what do I need to do to show Im worthy. And it better not be boring either". Giving the tall figure a stern look of seriousness .As if the man is just pulling his leg. The tall figure emotionless, stares dead in his eyes and reveal his face showing his battle-hardened face and a deep scare on his left eye.. Quntamiun's eyes opened realizing this guy mean serious business. With a deep grim voice the mysterious figure speaks, "Im only going to say this once so listen carefully. Go home and get some rest, we'll meet again at the shipping dock by day break and we go off by there. Don't make me wait for you". The tall figure walked away, blending into the crowed, Quntamium unfrozen from his gaze didn't wait and rushed back home. At the silent dark night Quntamiun on his mammock trying to get some sleep, but his mind was obsess over the mysterious man and what is to expect when he makes it to the dock, and worries  happensif he wake up late to never see the man again. "I always wanted to go on adventures ever since I saw the three warriors. The opprounity opened for me I must not fail", filling his mind with determination he carved a message on a tree so he won't forget then went to sleep.</p>
