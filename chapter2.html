 <div>
    <p>That night Quntanium was over joyed from that fight reenacting the fighting moves they'd preformed. He especially likes the swords man, swinging his blade in one clean cut. "one day I want to have a cool sword" he said. Exaugsted he went to bed hoping he'll see those warriors again and go on amazing adventures. When the sun rises Quntanium didn't waste a minute and went back the market place in search of the three warriors again, on high alert he traveled all round the plaza square. But to no avail he didn't find the three warriors. "mmm maybe they're somewhere in this plaza, no worries I'll prove my worthiness for adventure". He thought to himself but there is just one problem. How to exactly show he was worthy for adventure. He thinked and wondered, what makes a person adventurous? Then he heard something not afar, cries of a little child and laughter of 3 people, Quntanium immediately investigate the situation. What he found was a crying kid on the ground and 3 tall boys, one seeming to hold a sack. "Bullies" he said to himself, looking around noticing that no one is helping the crying kid. He wondered to himself, "does being adventous means to help a little kid from bullies?". Then he remembered what the three warriors did, fighting that monster to save the people from harm.</p>
<p>So he decided to face the bullies himself, with the three warriors being there or not, he felt it was right to put an end to it. "HEY!!!, LEAVE THE KID ALONE AND PICK SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE!!!". He felt his heart drop, knowing he'll regret what he said. The bullies turn toward him circling around him, "Yea what YOU gonna do about it freak" one of the bullies took a quick glance at his non-human apperence, and in a joking way he asked "What are even supposed to he ehh".
    That moment Quntanium had to think quickly before its too late. "I-I am shark", sweating bullets running down his face and shaking he stood his ground like a statue. "Yea right!" The bully behind him attempted to grab his tail and rip it off showing it's a fake. In that moment Quntanium quickly kicks the sack out the bully's hand, the sack went high into the air, swinging his tail to pick up dust to attract much attention on him. Quntanium ran like a rabbit and the bullies chased after him. Quntanium trying to keep the bullies off of him yet keeping distance so they don't loses him. Quntanium turned in all directions left and right trying to get them far away from the kid and the sack. Quntanium ever more running out of breath as the chase prolonged he hated making his decision and thought he was better off minding his own bussines. One of the bullies so got to him and pulled him by his tail swing him to the opposite direction, Quntanium on the ground he can only expect the worst from them. The bullies jumped him kicking and punching all over his body, Quntanium felt it last forever. At dusk the bullies were done walking away and laughing.</p>
<p>Quntanium layed on the ground just to make sure they were far away from him. Soon he got up, all bruised up and cuts all over him with tears rolling down his eyes he strolled on back home. Wondering if all that was worth it just to save a random kid's sack. "Man I hope that kid was happy to get away because if I see him I-" right before he got to say another word there stood the same kid with that sack and a tall women standing beside him. "Is this the boy who saved you from the bullies" she said in a soft tone. The kid nodes yes and ran to hug Quntanium as a thank you. Quntanium with a warm happy feeling he hugs the kid back. The mother noticing his wounds and explained to Quntanium that the boy was out to buy ingredients with that sack of money. "Here let me take you to our home for dinner and I'll patch you up". Delighted with the request Quntanium happily accepts.
After dinner and all patched up Quntanium waved goodby then walked back home. A bright optomisic feeling inside his heart glowed ever brightly. He finally found his purpose of what it means to be adventrous, helping others in need. He gazed upon the stars with joyful tears in his eyes, "one day I'll be a great warrior like them, saving people from danger no matter the cost". The stars and moon yet very far away shine brightly throught the night. Quntanium standing at the shore ,where the water touching his legs, looking down at the ocean mirror casting a reflection of a brusied yet determined shark. The night can never be more beautiful than this....</p>
