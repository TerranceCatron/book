    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
 <div id="paragraphs">
    <p>In a specific area located in the pacific ocean at the moonlit night Quntanium was born, washed up on the shores of New South Wales, Australia. Quntamium doesnt now where he is nor who he came from. All he knows he is from the ocean, staring up in the night sky poundering the beauty of it. Days, weeks, and months have past still living on the shore he washed up on on, Quntanium survives by hunting hunting fish, finding native fruits, and scavage whatever is there. It was a confortable life but he grew quite lonely and bored wondering if there is more out for him in the world. Soon he grew courage and set foot to a nearby market place in search for opprotunity. At the market place he wandered and wandered, amazed at the items and shops. People began noticing his shark-like apperence and suspecting if Quntamium is just a human pretending to be some sort of "walking land-shark". Soon Quntanium went into a mirror shop and saw a clear reflection of himself; Quntanium had gray-ish skin and a white underbelly with dark blue stripes from his ears to this tail and his eyes are a teal color.</p>
    <p>Suddenly a big crash was heard all around the market, screams and shouts raising as the crowd scatter, while some stayed to see the action. Quntanium existing out the shop, a rush of fear and desire to find out the commotion, have so he made his decision to follow the crowd. In the debrie and dust stood three worriers and a human-like monster with glowing blood-red eyes, teeth sharp as knives, and skin like a dead man. One of the warriors shouted "DONT GO NEAR HIM HES A EVIL SPIRIT!", Another ran towards the monster brandishing his sword, a clean slash was stroke and the monster shrieked in pain flying back and crashing into a nearby stand. The third warrior elegantly jumped into the air and with a thunderous kick the monster was slain. In the noisy chattering crowd with concern and some complaints about their damaged stores. At a stand still, Quntanium with an experession of a young child seeing his first action movie felt a burst of excitement and awe. Quntanium needed to find out who those warriors are. The three warriors were standing together, one complaning in a feminine tone "Hey try not to hit so many stands next time, people here don't like us enough already" another warrior in a masculine voice replies "what do you expect me to do let him attack us, gotta strike when they least expect it. The moment was perfect". The last warrior, a female standing over the cursed spirit's body uses a lantern to capture the spirit. She calmy says "hey atleast we got that spirit, proof to the squad master that we werent out fighting some random guy. This time...." </p>
    <p>Quntanium appering in front of the three asking with stars in his eyes "let me come with you please I want to go on amazing adventures and fight monsters like what yall did, that was so cool". Like a child asking his mother for a toy that peaks his interest he was dying for adventure. The three warriors laughed and denied his request saying he's better off playing sports with the other kids-like. Quntanium with a burning passion in his soul swear an oath that he'll follow them ends of the earth and prove he's ready for adventure.</p>
